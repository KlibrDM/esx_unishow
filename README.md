# esx_unishow
## Description
With this script you can have NPC Private Dances in Vanilla Unicorn. You can also throw money on the stage, it will all go into Vanilla Unicorn society account and possibly make it a profitable business. 

This is a modified version of esx_unishow, made by gregos1810. This was the very first script I worked on and I'm sorry if the code is all over the place and comments don't exist.
